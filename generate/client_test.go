// GeneratedClientSuite is a test suite that validates the behavior of service clients generated for languages other
// than Go. It relies on you having a "runner" executable in the client's target language that runs one of the test
// cases we want to test and parses stdout of that program to determine whether the test should pass/fail.
//
// The suite contains the logic to fire up a local instance of the gateway for the client to hit on the desired port
// as well as the ability to shut it down after the test. You can then analyze each line of stdout to determine if
// each interaction behaved as expected and write your Go assertions based on that. There will be more detail in the
// Abide architecture Markdown docs as to how this all works.
